It is not her most philosophical book. It is not always right; and it is decidedly not her most popular piece of writing. I did not even like the book myself when I first read it—I was an ardent young Socialist-Zionist and Arendt's conclusions profoundly disturbed me. But in the years since then I have come to understand that Eichmann in Jerusalem represents Hannah Arendt at her best.",

   "title": "Michael Lewis on How Merrill Lynch and Brian Lenihan Stuck the People of Ireland with a Debt of €106 Billion | Vanity Fair",
   "description": "Vanity Fair contributing editor Michael Lewis shows how Merrill Lynch and two troubled Irish banks convinced Ireland’s finance minister, Brian Lenihan, to sign off on having his country’s taxpayers foot the bill for an estimated €106 billion in property-related losses. Lenihan and the Irish government approved the measures to make foreign owners of Irish bank bonds—including Goldman Sachs and German and French banks—whole again. As Lewis writes, “These private bondholders didn’t even expect to be made whole by the Irish government People who had made a private bet that went bad, and didn’t expect to be repaid in full, were handed their money back—from the Irish taxpayer.”What was Merrill Lynch’s role in this? Months before Anglo Irish, Bank of Ireland, and Allied Irish Bank, Ireland’s three biggest banks, went bust, Phil Ingram, a research analyst for Merrill Lynch in London, published a report that shed light on their dire situation owing to aggressive commercial-real-estate lending practices. His report was almost immediately retracted by his superiors, then edited and softened. Six months later, at the request of the Irish government, Merrill Lynch threw together a seven-page memo that stated, “All of the Irish banks are profitable and well capitalised”—which soon proved to be an utter falsehood.  For this Merrill charged the Irish government €7 million.",

   "title": "The Tragedy of the European Union and How to Resolve It | George Soros | The New York Review of Books",
   "description": "If and when the euro eventually breaks up it will destroy the common market and the European Union. Europe will be worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began, because the breakup will leave a legacy of mutual mistrust and hostility. The later it happens, the worse the ultimate outcome. That is such a dismal prospect that it is time to consider alternatives that would have been inconceivable until recently. In my judgment the best course of action is to persuade Germany to choose between becoming a more benevolent hegemon, or leading nation, or leaving the euro. In other words, Germany must lead or leave.",
